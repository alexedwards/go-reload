go-reload
=========

This is a Bash script for automatically reloading Go programs. It acts as a
wrapper for `go run`, stopping and restarting the process whenever a `.go` file
in your current directory or `$GOPATH/src` folder is saved.

It comes in useful when developing Go web applications.

Installation
------------

1) Install [inotify-tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools) and clone
this repository:

    $ sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
    $ git clone https://github.com/alexedwards/go-reload.git

2) Make the script executable and move it to somewhere on your system path. For
example:

    $ cd go-reload
    $ chmod +x go-reload
    $ sudo mv go-reload /usr/local/bin/

Usage
-----

Use the script in place of `go run`. For example:

    $ go-reload main.go
    == Go-reload
    >> Watching directories, CTRL+C to stop
